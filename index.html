<h2> Mental Health Helper </h2>
<p> Squishmallows are an excellent way to improve one's mental health. 
  Just looking at the plushie is an automatic way to make your day. 
  Their expressions are filled with in infectious joy. Not to mention, 
  they're super soft and excellent to squeeze and *perhaps* punch if you're 
heartless enough to punch a helpless squishmallow. The perfect coping mechinism.</p>

<h2> Customizable Critters </h2>
<p> There are tons of different squishmallow animals ranging from frogs to dragons.
  Each one comes equipped with their own name, hobby and pronouns listed on the tag. 
  So there's a range of animals, and range of genders. The range of genders/pronouns is especially 
 appealing as it normalizes these things for the younger audiences buying them.
